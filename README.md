# Natural Language Processing Applied to Trump's Speeches

How have President Trump's talking points and rhetoric changed in the past year leading up to the 2020 election? Were there trends that the outbreak of COVID-19 strengthened? Negated? 

In this project, our group sought to answer these questions and more using natural language processing methods and tools such as topic mining and modeling. used Google Colab and Selenium to scrape 20 transcripts of President Trump's speeches between January 19, 2019 and August 2020 from the Miller Center. Once we cleaned the data and performed some exploratory analysis (e.g., word counts, basic lifts between top-of-mind topics), we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation to mine topics from the 20 speeches.
